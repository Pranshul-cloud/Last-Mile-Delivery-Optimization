# üì¶ Last-Mile Delivery Optimization ‚Äì Business Cost Reduction Project

### A data-driven initiative to reduce last-mile delivery costs and delays by improving routing, rider utilization, and zone performance using real-world delivery data.

---

## ‚ùì 1. Problem Statement

Last-mile delivery is the most expensive and operationally complex segment of the logistics chain. This project addresses:

- Rising delivery costs and inconsistent efficiency across zones and riders  
- Unclear business impact, though initial indicators suggest high cost leakage and potential for optimization

---

## üéØ 2. Business Objectives

This analysis aims to deliver actionable improvements in last-mile operations. The core goals are:

- Reduce average delivery time across all orders  
- Decrease delivery cost per order through operational efficiency  
- Improve rider and zone-level productivity and workload balance

## üìÇ 3. Dataset Overview

### Primary Dataset:

This project uses a structured delivery operations dataset that captures real-time delivery metadata and rider logistics.

**Key Columns:**

- `Order_ID`  
- `Agent_age`, `Agent_rating`  
- `Store_latitude`, `Store_longitude`  
- `Drop_latitude`, `Drop_longitude`  
- `Order_date`, `Order_time`, `Pickup_time`  
- `Idle_time_before_pickup`  
- `Weather`, `Traffic`, `Vehicle`  
- `Area`, `Category`  
- `Distance`, `Speed`, `Delivery_Duration_mins`  

### Data Source:

- Publicly available dataset from **Kaggle**  
- [Kaggle Link: Last-Mile Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujalsuthar/amazon-delivery-dataset)
