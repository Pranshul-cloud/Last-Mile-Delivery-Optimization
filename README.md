# üì¶ Last-Mile Delivery Optimization ‚Äì Business Cost Reduction Project

### A data-driven initiative to reduce last-mile delivery costs and delays by improving routing, rider utilization, and zone performance using real-world delivery data.

---

## ‚ùì 1. Problem Statement

Last-mile delivery is the most expensive and operationally complex segment of the logistics chain. This project addresses:

- Rising delivery costs and inconsistent efficiency across zones and riders  
- Unclear business impact, though initial indicators suggest high cost leakage and potential for optimization

---

## üéØ 2. Business Objectives

This analysis aims to deliver actionable improvements in last-mile operations. The core goals are:

- Reduce average delivery time across all orders  
- Decrease delivery cost per order through operational efficiency  
- Improve rider and zone-level productivity and workload balance

 ## üõ†Ô∏è 6.  Implementation Approach

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Imported initial delivery dataset from [Kaggle](Kaggle Link: Last-Mile Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujalsuthar/amazon-delivery-dataset)  
   - Addressed missing values, standardized zone naming, and synchronized timestamps  
   - Cleaned files are archived in `/1_data/1.1_clean_data/`
2. **Business Problem Framing**  
   - Articulated eight high‚Äëvalue questions focusing on delay sources, agent dynamics, and environmental effects  
   - Documentation of each question resides in `/2_sql_analysis/2.1_business_questions/`

3. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Developed and optimized SQL scripts to answer all business questions, handling nulls and complex joins  
   - Stored final queries in `/2_sql_analysis/2.2_sql_queries/`

4. **Prioritization & Visualization**  
   - Selected four questions with the greatest business impact and stakeholder relevance (e.g., semi‚Äëurban delays, traffic + weather effects, idle‚Äëtime peaks)  
   - Generated supporting charts and tables for delivery duration, idle‚Äëtime trends, and zone‚Äëlevel comparisons  
   - Dashboard source files and exported visuals are available in `/3_executive_report/3.1_dashboard/`
    
5. **Insights & Recommendations Documentation**  
   - Synthesized key findings into concise insights and strategic recommendations  
   - Compiled and formatted the final report in `/3_executive_report/3.3_insights_and_recommendations/`  
   - Ensured alignment with stakeholder objectives and clarity for decision‚Äëmaking
  
  ## üìä 7.  Dashboard Highlights

- **Key Performance Metrics**  
  - **Average Delivery Speed:** 8.23‚ÄØkm/h  
  - **Average Delivery Distance:** 14.76‚ÄØkm  
  - **Average Idle Time Before Pickup:** 9.93‚ÄØmins  
  - **Average Delivery Time:** 142.12‚ÄØmins  

- **Traffic & Weather Impact**  
  Under **Jam** traffic with **cloudy** or **stormy** conditions, median delivery times spike to **180‚ÄØmins**, while even **High** traffic in poor weather sustains durations above **135‚ÄØmins**‚Äîunderscoring the need for dynamic routing and weather‚Äëaware scheduling.

- **Area‚ÄëLevel Delivery Efficiency**  
  **Semi‚ÄëUrban** zones trail other regions significantly, with average delivery times nearing **230‚ÄØmins**, compared to **120‚ÄØmins** in metropolitan and **110‚ÄØmins** in urban areas‚Äîhighlighting prime candidates for hub relocation or micro‚Äëfulfillment centers.

- **Idle‚ÄëTime Trends**  
  Driver wait times peak at **10.5‚ÄØmins** around **10‚ÄØAM** and **2‚ÄØPM**, suggesting bottlenecks in order batching and pickup coordination that could be alleviated with staggered dispatch windows.

- **Category Consistency**  
  Delivery durations by product category remain tightly clustered (131‚Äì134‚ÄØmins), with **Cosmetics** at the high end (133.7‚ÄØmins) and **Electronics** at the low end (131.9‚ÄØmins), indicating that category‚Äëspecific handling times have minimal variance.
